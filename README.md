# Nokia 3310 Snake Game

This project is a modern re-creation of the classic Snake game, originally popularized by Nokia 3310. 
It features a retro design with a monospace font and minimalist graphics, designed to mimic the original game experience. 
The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Retro Aesthetics**: Utilizes VT323, a pixelated font similar to that used in classic video terminals, to enhance the nostalgic feel.
- **Dynamic High Score Tracking**: Players can enter their name to record high scores, which are saved and displayed in the game.
- **Responsive Game Controls**: The snake can be controlled with keyboard inputs (W, A, S, D).
